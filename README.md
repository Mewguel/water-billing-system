#A Water Billing System Web App

Implementing an online billing and payment portal for water bills in CWRVC addresses the need for a more efficient and convenient payment process. By leveraging IE tools in the project's development, we can enhance user experience and streamline operations. The survey questionnaire serves as a valuable tool to gauge consumer interest and tailor the portal to meet their needs effectively. This approach not only modernizes billing processes but also aligns with consumer preferences for digital solutions in utility management.
